title: "Time of the Flight of the Gaussians: Fast and Accurate Dynamic Time-of-Flight Radiance Fields"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/gtorf
excerpt: "We adapt Gaussian splatting for dynamic continuous-wave time-of-flight radiance fields reconstruction and propose two optimization heuristics that address the discrepancy problem between the rendered mean depth and the depth from rendered raw ToF frames, enabling 100x faster training, >100Hz rendering speed, and more accurate depth."
